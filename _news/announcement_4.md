Shoutout to **Harsh Nishant Lalai**. He is exploring PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.

He has strong theoretical grounding, careful experimental design, and the engineering maturity to turn concepts into working systems. If your lab values both depth and execution, I highly recommend him (Harsh is awesome).
