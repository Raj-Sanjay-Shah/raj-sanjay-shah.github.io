Shoutout to **Harsh Nishant Lalai** — the co-author behind our text watermarking taxonomy, naive-misconception probes, and half the safety stack on this site. He’s on the lookout for Fall 2026 PhD programs focused on LLM safety / evaluation. If your lab needs someone who ships both theory and tools, DM me and I’ll intro you.
