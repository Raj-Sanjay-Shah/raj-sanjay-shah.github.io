# Research

My work clusters around three themes-Core NLP & Model Ops, AI ↔ Cognition, and AI for Mental Health-and these pages go deeper into each. The research page below summarizes the most current projects, the recent completions, pre-PhD work, and associated patents.

## Ongoing projects

- **Naïve Scientific Misconceptions in Large Language Models** - Investigating if and how LLMs internalize childish or naive theories, especially when primed with misleading data.
- **Understanding Graphical Perception in Data Visualization** - Extending the arXiv preprint ([2411.00257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00257)) into a formal evaluation suite that compares human visual cognition to vision-language models and develops better prompts for graphs.
- **AI Patient Bank** - Building state-based simulated patients grounded in therapeutic source texts and vetted via evidence-based testing (collaborators: Nathan Paek, William Fang, Hercy Shen, Declan Grabb, Emma Brunskill, Diyi Yang, Ryan Louie).
- **Ask Before You Summarize: Clarification-Driven Summaries from Dialogue Transcripts** - Admission of uncertainty and clarification elicitations for richer automated summarization (with Han-Chin Shing, Lei Xu, Joseph Paul Cohen, Jack Moriarty, Chaitanya Shivade).
- **Responsible Evaluation of AI for Mental Health** - Drafting standardized evaluation protocols before deployment; see the preprint [2602.00065](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00065).
