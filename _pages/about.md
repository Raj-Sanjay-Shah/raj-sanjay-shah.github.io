<p>
I’m Raj, a PhD student in Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech (advised by <a href="https://ic.gatech.edu/people/sashank-varma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sashank Varma</a>) and a visiting researcher in <a href="http://www.diyiyang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diyi Yang’s SALT Lab</a> at Stanford. My job-talk story is about building AI systems that stay trustworthy when the stakes are human well-being.
</p>

<p>
I pull on three research threads:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reliable model operations.</strong> Dynamic unlearning evaluations, watermarking, and continual learning recipes that keep LLMs accountable once they leave the lab.</li>
  <li><strong>LLMs as cognitive probes.</strong> Developmentally staged corpora (BabyLM) and psych-aligned batteries that reveal when models follow—or ignore—human reasoning trajectories.</li>
  <li><strong>AI for mental health.</strong> Counselor copilots, MI-aware feedback loops, and evaluation protocols that center safety for both helpers and seekers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Across these threads I ship practical tooling: pip packages for unlearning stress tests, open MI datasets + coaching sandboxes, and benchmark suites for finance, healthcare, and visualization literacy. If you’re evaluating LLMs in the wild (or just want to see the job-talk deck), reach out.
