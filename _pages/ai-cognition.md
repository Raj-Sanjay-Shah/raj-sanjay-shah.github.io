## AI ↔ Cognition

Large language models double as computational subjects. This theme captures how BabyLM, cognitive batteries, and psycholinguistic analyses expose where models follow—or diverge from—human developmental trajectories.

### Featured Work

- **Teaching Language Models to Grow Up** — Developmentally staged corpora and cognitive test batteries.
- **How Well Do Deep Learning Models Capture Human Concepts?** — Typicality effects and concept representations.

### Highlights

1. **Developmental Alignment**
   - Age-restricted corpora (BabyLM challenge) for staged learning
   - Curriculum experiments that mimic child-directed input

2. **Psych-inspired Evaluation Batteries**
   - Garden-path recovery, numerical magnitude, typicality gradients
   - Linking hypotheses mapping behavioral signatures to model internals

3. **Theory ↔ Practice Loop**
   - Insights that inform safer training objectives
   - Cognitive science collaborations that keep the benchmarks grounded

### Get Involved

- Submit to the next BabyLM workshop
- Run your model through the cognitive battery and share results
- Co-design new linking hypotheses bridging psych data and LLM latents

Reach out if you want to pair up—this line thrives on interdisciplinary partnerships.
