### LLM Copilots for Peer Counselors

Simulation sandbox + MI-aware feedback loop that upskills novice peer counselors in minutes. Includes annotated datasets, coaching rubrics, and randomized controlled trials showing significant MI gains.

### Dynamic Unlearning Evaluation ("Unlearning Mirage")

A pip-installable framework that elicits knowledge from a model, generates multi-hop probes, and traces activation pathways to reveal where "forgotten" facts still leak.

### Naïve Scientific Misconceptions in LLMs

Stress tests GPT-4o and peers on child-like misconceptions (gravity, astronomy, biology). Supports my job talk demos about why multi-hop reasoning still resurrects naïve theories.

### AI Patient Bank & TN-Eval

State-based simulated patients plus behavioral-therapy note rubrics so practitioners can safely test LLM interventions before deployment.

### Graphical Perception & Domain Evaluations

Benchmarks for finance, clinical narratives, and misleading data visualizations. These suites anchor the “real world consequences” story in the job talk.

For code, datasets, and preprints see the blog posts or the publications page-everything is linked there. If you’d like a deeper dive on any project, reach out and I’ll share the latest slide deck.
