## AI for Mental Health

This theme focuses on building trustworthy copilots for peer-support counselors: simulation sandboxes, MI-aware feedback, and analytics that keep humans in the loop.

### Featured Work

- **LLM Copilots for Peer Counselors** - Practice environments, rubric-aligned feedback, and deployment results.
- **Helping the Helper / Multi-Level Feedback Generation** - Empirical evidence from CSCW, CHI, and ACL venues.

### Highlights

1. **Skill Modeling & Data Pipelines**
   - Motivational interviewing annotations at scale
   - Turn-level intent + strategy tagging for nuanced feedback

2. **Practice & Feedback Loops**
   - LLM-driven seeker simulations with immediate coaching
   - Tiered suggestions (“Try a double-sided reflection”) grounded in transcripts

3. **Platform Analytics & Safety**
   - Dashboards that surface counselor progress and risk flags
   - Upcoming randomized trials showing real-world skill uplift

### Ways to Engage

- Integrate the coaching sandbox into your peer-support platform
- Collaborate on new MI annotation drives or safety overlays
- Join the randomized evaluations to test efficacy in your community
